# Flask Skeleton
A simple flask skeleton to be cloned and then used for starting small flask applications easily. The HTML and CSS isn't perfect but the skeleton will allow you to get started quickly. To use, go to the directory where you'd like to start and run, `git clone https://github.com/zachchao/FlaskSkeleton`.

# How to use
## app.py
Run this to start your local server on http://localhost:5000/. This is also where you put all routes for your application.

## /templates
This is where you put all of your html templates for doing a {% include 'template.html %} or for rendering templates in app.py.
